                <p>Brutalist architecture, or New Brutalism, is an architectural style which emerged during the 1950s in
                    Great Britain, among the reconstruction projects of the post-war era.[1][2][3] Brutalist buildings
                    are characterised by minimalist constructions that showcase the bare building materials and
                    structural elements over decorative design.[4][5] The style commonly makes use of exposed concrete
                    or brick, angular geometric shapes and a predominantly monochrome colour palette;[6][5] other
                    materials, such as steel, timber, and glass, are also featured.</p>

                <p>Descending from the modernist movement, Brutalism is said to be a reaction against the nostalgia of
                    architecture in the 1940s.[8] Derived from the Swedish phrase nybrutalism, the term "New Brutalism"
                    was first used by British architects Alison and Peter Smithson for their pioneering approach to
                    design.[9][6][10] The style was further popularised in a 1955 essay by architectural critic Reyner
                    Banham, who also associated the movement with the French phrases béton brut ("raw concrete") and art
                    brut ("raw art").[11][12] The style, as developed by architects such as the Smithsons and
                    Hungarian-born Ernő Goldfinger, was partly foreshadowed by the work of other architects such as
                    French-Swiss Le Corbusier, Estonian-American Louis Kahn and Finnish Alvar Aalto.</p>

                <p>The term Nybrutalism (New Brutalism)[16] was coined by the Swedish architect Hans Asplund to describe
                    Villa Göth, a modern brick home in Uppsala, designed in January 1950[9] by his contemporaries Bengt
                    Edman and Lennart Holm.[10] Showcasing the 'as found' design approach that would later be at the
                    core of Brutalism the house displays visible i-beams over windows, exposed brick inside and out, and
                    poured concrete in several rooms where the tongue-and-groove pattern of the boards used to build the
                    forms can be seen.[17][11] The term was picked up in the summer of 1950 by a group of visiting
                    English architects, including Michael Ventris, Oliver Cox, and Graeme Shankland, where it apparently
                    "spread like wildfire, and subsequently adopted by a certain faction of young British architects".

                <p>The first published usage of the phrase "New Brutalism" occurred in 1953, when Alison Smithson used
                    it to describe a plan for their unbuilt Soho house which appeared in the November issue of
                    Architectural Design.[11][7] She further stated "It is our intention in this building to have the
                    structure exposed entirely, without interior finishes wherever practicable."[10][11] The Smithsons'
                    Hunstanton School completed in 1954 in Norfolk, and the Sugden House completed in 1955 in Watford,
                    represent the earliest examples of New Brutalism in the United Kingdom.[2] Hunstanton school, likely
                    inspired by Mies Van Der Rohe's 1946 Alumni Memorial Hall at the Illinois Institute of Technology in
                    Chicago, USA, is notable as the first completed building in the world to carry the title of "New
                    Brutalist" by its architects.[19][20] At the time, it was described as "the most truly modern
                    building in England".</p>
